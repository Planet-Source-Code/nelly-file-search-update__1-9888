## File Search \(UPDATE\)


</div>

### Description

I recieved an e.mail from Randy Porosky asking if can update

the Application so it would search for multiple Files and

list the Search Name only, well, it now searches for multiple

Files and adds the search name to a seperate listbox. You

would expect the search to take double the time when adding

another File to the SearchList, but with a litte recursive

programming it only adds approx 0.6 seconds to the search time.

So again, this Application will search for multiple Files on

multiple Drives, Folders etc, VERY FAST, eg. On my system it

took 3.5sec to search 1079 Folders for 1 File, because of the

recursive programming it took 4.1sec to search 1079 Folders

for 2 Files.
 
### More Info
 
Search String

Read the Capital comments first

True if Found

This is FAST
